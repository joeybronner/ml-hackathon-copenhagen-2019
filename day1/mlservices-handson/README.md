# Postman Collection

The Collection contains examples that you can import to test the LMF services. Note that you will need to create an environment with:

- API_KEY: this needs to be set to the key that you can get from SAP API hub.

The other values are if you are using an actual CF account with ML services:

- LML_OAUTH_TOKEN: this can be left empty as it will be filled in automatically
- USER_NAME: the user name from your cloud ML account if you have one
- PASSWORD: the password for the above account.
