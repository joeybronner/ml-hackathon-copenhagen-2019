# ML Hackathon ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡°Copenhagen 2019

Please note that these are examples for the purposes of training only. This repository will not be supported or maintained. 

Under code samples there are some simple examples that will be used to show how you can use LML in your applications.

Postman contains collections that you can import to test the services. Note that you will need to create an environment with:

- LML_OAUTH_TOKEN: this can be left empty as it will be filled in automatically
- API_KEY: this needs to be set to the key that you can get from SAP API hub.
